# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
In this [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), participants are challenged to predict which passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on their gender, social status, and age etc.

In this kernel, I experimented with some more advanced data transformation methods in order to help simplify the prediction process. This includes creating new columns, and computing missing values etc. Several models including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, k-nearest Neighbors, Gaussian, and Random Forest were fine-tuned for better results. Additionally, a simple model stacking method was applied.
